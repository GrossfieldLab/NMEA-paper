Scripts used to generate data and figures for anisotropic terahertz spectroscopy paper

Romo, Grossfield, and Markelz, "Identification of functionally important collective vibrations through terahertz Normal Mode Ensemble Analysis"

Simulation: parameters and input files for running the MD simulations

Spectrum: collection of scripts used to compute the VDOS and absorbance spectra, including the CHARMM input scripts

Analysis: scripts to analyze and average the data, including the projections of modes onto the difference between structures

random-projections: code to generate the distribution of dot products in high dimensions. Used to create Supplemental Figure 3.
